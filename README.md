# FlexTest
## Environment used
Eclipse IDE

## Troubles
With the test runner file only being the binary .class file with no source code, so I was unable to successfully run the tests on the code through eclipse.

## Additional Thoughts
I was able to run manual tests on the functionality and there appeared to be no issues with the integration code.

This was a nice test and there was some functionality with the HTTP requests that I wasn't too familiar with at the start but I was able to work it out.
